## [Unreleased]

### Changed — BREAKING

- **CORE-MEMORY-DYNAMICS-1 M1b: `working` → `pending` rename.** Standalone MCP consumers follow the core rename: `_LEGACY_RECALL_TYPE_SCOPE` in `smartmemory_mcp/tools/memory_tools.py` updated to `{"pending"}` (regression test against the service repo's scope also updated). `evolution_dream` tool becomes a no-op with deprecation notice — the underlying `commit_working_to_*` façade was removed in core. `evolution_status` now counts `memory_type="pending"` items and reports `"Pending memory items (formerly 'working')"`.

### Added

- **CORE-MEMORY-DYNAMICS-1 M1a: `get_working_context` MCP tool + `memory_recall` deprecated shim.** Mirrors the service repo's migration (`smart-memory-service` Tasks 5.2 + 5.3) but composes directly against `backend.search` since the standalone has no `SmartMemory` instance. New `_build_working_context(backend, session_id, query, k, max_tokens, strategy)` helper produces contract-shape response per `smart-memory-docs/docs/features/CORE-MEMORY-DYNAMICS-1/context-api-contract.json` (items with `score_breakdown`, `strategy_used="fast:recency"` literal, `tokens_used` with `max(1, len//4)` estimator, `BudgetTooSmall` when smallest item > `max_tokens`). New `get_working_context` MCP tool validates `k` in 1..100 and calls the helper. `memory_recall` becomes a deprecated shim: preserves the native `backend.recall()` fast path when present and `session_id` is None; otherwise delegates to `_build_working_context` with 10× over-fetch clamped to 100, applies **legacy-scope post-filter** via module-level `_LEGACY_RECALL_TYPE_SCOPE = {"working"}` (derived from pre-shim body at `smartmemory_mcp/tools/memory_tools.py:241`, asserted identical to the service repo by a regression test), then applies the original per-session `metadata.conversation_id`/`session_id` filter before `_format_recall`. One-shot `DeprecationWarning` logged per process. Standalone does not compose anchors (no `AnchorQueries`). 13 unit tests cover contract shape, exact-fit budget, empty/`None` search results, scope-filter correctness, deprecation-once, session filtering, and the scope-match regression against the service repo.
